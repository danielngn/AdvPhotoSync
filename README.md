# AdvPhotoSync
Sync a complete replica of your photo repository at a different resolution

This is particularly useful when the original copy of your photo is at very high resolution (which most modern carmeras do nowadays), when accessed from slow device or over slow network, can create significant performance issue. By syning out another copy of your entire photo collection, but at lower resolutions, e.g., 4k resolution, it will greatly improve performance and user experience.
